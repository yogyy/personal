                  I live in Tangerang, Indonesia. I&apos;m interested in becoming a full-stack web
                  developer. As a naturally curious person, I am always seeking ways to improve and
                  achieve{' '}
                  <span className="font-semibold text-red-500 line-through">perfection</span>
                  &nbsp; better code in my work.They say practice makes perfect, but then again,
                  they also say that nobody&apos;s perfect, so I guess that means I don&apos;t have
                  to practice...
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There are a lot of things and technologies to learn in frontend development and I
                  am motivated to learn as much as possible. I enjoy learning something new and
                  getting feedback to make myself better and improve.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In this website I will be writing some blogs and showcase my projects. I believe
                  that writing what I have learned is the best way to remember things, and I can
                  share my knowledge along the way. So do contact me and I will be very happy to
                  help!
