## Short Explanation

This project is a small-scale social media platform that aims to resemble Twitter in terms of functionality and design. It provides users with a platform to express their thoughts, share updates, and engage in conversations with other users. The main goal is to create a simplified version of Twitter with limited features.

My project is a social media built using NextJs. Some of the features that have been implemented include:

- üîí User Registration and Authentication.

- ‚úâÔ∏è Posting Tweets.

- üë§ User Profiles.

However, there are still some features that I plan to add in the future:

- üë• Follow Functionality

- ‚ù§Ô∏è Like and Comment on Tweets.

## Project Goals

The project aims to replicate essential features of Twitter, including posting tweets, following/unfollowing users, liking tweets, commenting on tweets, and displaying personalized feeds. The platform should closely emulate the user experience of Twitter, providing a familiar environment for users.

This project uses a range of technologies & libraries, including:

- Next.js: Used as the main framework for building the project, providing server-side rendering, easy routing, and optimized builds

- Tailwind CSS: Used as the main styling framework to rapidly build and style UI components.

- Clerk: Used for Authentication.

- React Query: Used for data fetching and caching in a performant and easy-to-use way.
