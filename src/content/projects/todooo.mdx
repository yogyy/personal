## Short Explanation

As part of my introduction to web development, I've built a basic To-Do List app. This app enables users to input, update, and track their tasks online. Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, setting the stage for more complex projects in the future.

## Project Goals

The goal of creating a to-do list app is to help users organize their tasks and increase their productivity. A to-do list app can provide several benefits such as creating order in one's life, prioritizing tasks, breaking down big projects into manageable tasks, and reducing wastage of time.

## Tech Stack Used

This project uses a range of technologies & libraries, including:

- ReactJS: is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It enables you to create reusable UI components that update automatically when the underlying data changes.

- Zustand: state management library for React applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage your application's state while keeping the benefits of the React component model.

- Tailwind CSS: Used as the main styling framework to rapidly build and style UI components.
