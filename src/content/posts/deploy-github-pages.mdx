before we started, it's important to ensure that you have already created a GitHub repository for your project.

### Step 1. Change Vite Config

add `base` like this example :

```ts
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/your-project-name/',
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
});
```

### Step 2. Build Your Project

this example using npm

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3. Run git add dist && git commit -m 'adding dist subtree'

```bash
git add dist && git commit -m 'adding dist subtree'
```

This commits our changes to the master branch so that we can create a `dist` subtree in the next step. Make sure that `dist` is not included in your `.gitignorefile!`

### Step 4. Run git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages

```bash
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

This step makes gh-pages a subtree of our main branch. The prefix option specifies the folder that we want for our the subtree. If we take a look at our gh-pages branch, we will see that it is equivalent to being the root of the dist folder.

#### If you want skip step 3 & 4

Access your repository, create a new branch named `gh-pages`, and upload the `dist` folder that was generated by following step 2 `npm run build`

### Final Step

In your repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab, select **Pages** under the **Code and automation** section. In the **Build and deployment** settings, modify the branch from `main` to `gh-pages`.

<p className="mt-6">
  <img className="rounded-md" draggable="false" src="/images/post/gh-pages.jpg" alt="test" />
</p>

In a few minutes, GitHub Pages should refresh with your newest repository changes, and you should be able to see your vite project online. Exciting!

<p className="mt-6">
  <img className="rounded-md" draggable="false" src="/images/post/result-gh-pages.jpg" alt="test" />
</p>
<hr className="my-6" />

#### That's it

However, if you're interested in automating this deployment process with CI/CD, you can refer to the guide at [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages) for more information on using Vite.js and GitHub Actions for a seamless deployment workflow.
